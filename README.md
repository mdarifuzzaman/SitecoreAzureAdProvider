# SitecoreAzureAdProvider
There are times when Sitecore Identity Server is disabled but we might need External provider to login to Sitecore Instance.
This approach will consider that. It will add "AzureAd" Provider to existing Providers and user can be able to login through that.

## Instruction
Please replace App Id and Tenant with your "App Id" and "Tenant".
